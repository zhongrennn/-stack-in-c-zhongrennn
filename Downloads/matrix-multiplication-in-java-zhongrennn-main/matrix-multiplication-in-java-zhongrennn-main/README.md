# Matrix Multiplication in Java

In this assignment, we will implement a Java program that can do matrix multiplicaiton. The program accepts two CSV filenames as input arguments and print the product in Numpy format. The command of program is
```bash
java MatrixMultiplication file1.csv file2.csv
```

The formula of matrix multipication is shown below. Suppose we have two matrix $A$ and $B$, 
$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. In other words, $A$ is a $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ is a $p \times q$ matrix. To do mupltiplicaiton, the number of columns of $A$ needs to be equal to the number of rows of $A$, which means $n = p$. The matrix product $C = AB$ can be calculated by:

For more details, please refer to [Wikipedia Matrix Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).


## Example 
Suppose we have two CSV matrix files, one is a 2-by-3 matrix and the other one is a 3-by-2 matrix:

**matrix1.csv**
```
1, 0, 0
0, 1, 0
```

**matrix2.csv**
```
1, 2
3, 4
5, 6
```

Run the command
```bash
java MatrixMultiplication matrix1.csv matrix2.csv
```

The output will be
```
[[1,2],
[3,4]]
```

## Write Your Code

The repository includes a template file **MatrixMultiplican.java** generated by ChatGPT. The program can read two CSV files and output a Zero matrix in Numpy format, but it didn't check the matrix dimensions. There are two things to do in the code:
1. Complete the matrix multiplication for loop to generate correct matrix product.
2. Add exception handling in function "**readMatrixFromFile()**"

Search the keyword **TODO** in the comments and fill in your code. Enjoy!
